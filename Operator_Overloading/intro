Operator Overloading=> part of polymorphism

-most imp feature of c++

-using the concept of operator overloading , we can overload any built in operator i.e we can assign a new defination to an existing operator.

for eg:
 + => built in
 cc = aa + bb (+)lai overloading garera use garna milxa

 normally use garne operator haru lai yedi objects class snga use garne ho vane teslai ni operator overloading vaninxa

 some operator which can not be overloaded are:
 1) scope resolution ::
 2)class member acces (.,*)
 3) size of operator
 4) conditional operator (?,:);
